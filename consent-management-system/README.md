# Consent management system

Rest-implementation of consent management system for XS2A Interface of Berlin Group

## Configuration and deployment
To interact with PostgreSQL DB properly, please add following parameters to your application.properties file 
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/yourDatabaseName
spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_schema=yourDatabaseName
```
We use liquibase for generating DB tables. Property file with settings you can find in resources folder. You can find brief instruction how to setup database quickly in the `cms-db-schema/README.md` file.

Some of these parameters you can obtain after installing and running PostgreSQL DB (see 'PostgreSQL database run and settings instuctions' section below)

# PostgreSQL database run and settings instuctions

  https://www.postgresql.org/download/

- Create a user and a password, add these parameters to your application.properties file instead of "yourUsername" and "yourPassword"
- Create a database with default settings, add the name of the database to your application.properties file instead of "yourDatabaseName"
```

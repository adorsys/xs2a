== Building Block View



=== Whitebox Overall System


image::L01-Whitebox.png[Whitebox Overall System Level 1, 80%, title="Whitebox Overall System Level 1", align="center"]


Motivation::
XS2A Service consists of several components that can be deployed as several services or as a modular monolith, depending on the requirements of particular ASPSP and possibilities to interconnection with other ASPSP systems.
Every service consists of one or more implementation Java libraries that can be started with the help of Spring boot starter modules or integrated into other ASPSP system as a part of bigger deployment.


Contained Building Blocks::
|===
| Component | Description

| [xs2a]#XS2A Service#
| Business-logic, validators and services operating to serve TPPs according to a Berlin Group operational rules defined by XS2A Interface.


| [xs2a]#ASPSP Profile#
| A service that provides static configuration of features, those are supported by actual ASPSP.

| [connector]#ASPSP-Connector#
| An implementation of SPI-API interface to connect XS2A-services with ASPSP internal system to process requests.
This part is to be implemented for each particular deployment, depending on underlying ASPSP systems.

| [xs2a]#CMS#
| Consent Management System - Service that persists and manages the PSUs Consents for account accesses and payments and corresponding to these consents data.
Provides internal CMS-PSU-API and CMS-APSPS-API interfaces for other internal ASPSP systems.
|===

Important Interfaces::
|===
| Interface | Description

| [xs2a]#XS2A#
| REST interfaces defined by Berlin Group NextgenPSD2 Standards. Serves TPPs to access the ASPSP Systems.

| [xs2a]#SPI-API#
| Internal Java interface to provide a universal way to implement connectors to underlying ASPSP Systems.

| [xs2a]#CMS-PSU-API#
| Internal ASPSP Java and/or REST interface to provide a possibility to perform payment/consent authorisation in bank systems.

| [xs2a]#CMS-ASPSP-API#
| Internal ASPSP Java and/or REST interface to provide an access to CMS-managed data from other ASPSP systems (generally - to read/export data, in some usecases also to manage data).

|===

External systems::
|===
| Component | Description
| [tpp]#TPP#
| Third-party provider, acting on behalf of PSU, operating the accounts/payment data of PSU provided by ASPSP through XS2A Interface.

| [tpp]#Certification Authority#
| A QWAC/QSEAL TLS Certificate issuer that operates under the conditions of PSD2 regulations.
|===

Surrounding ASPSP systems::
|===
| Component | Description
| [aspsp]#Gateway#
| A front ASPSPs system (Firewall or API Gateway) that performs termination of TLS connection on the ASPSP side. Is responsible for validation of TPP's QWAC TLS Certificate.

| [aspsp]#ASPSP#
| Represents set of ASPSP Systems that are responsible in particular for payments execution and management of PSU's accounts inside the ASPSP.

| [aspsp]#ASPSP Auth#
| Represents an ASPSP's System that is responsible for authentication and authorisation of PSU in ASPSP systems, including other online systems, like Online banking portal.

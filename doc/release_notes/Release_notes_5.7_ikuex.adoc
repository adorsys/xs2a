== Update Account Owner Name Service

From now on, Account Owner Name Service has several changes:

* In Consent request body "additionalAccountInformation" field was renamed to "additionalInformation";
* In Consent request body fields "availableAccounts", "availableAccountsWithBalance" and "allPsd2" may have additional value "allAccountsWithOwnerName";
* Field "ownerAddress" was removed from Consent request body and Account Details;

Also if TPP creates consent with additional information and the ASPSP doesn't support it (accountOwnerInformationSupported=false)
then TPP will receive HTTP 401 response code with message code "CONSENT_INVALID" and text message "An explicit consent of ownerName is not supported."

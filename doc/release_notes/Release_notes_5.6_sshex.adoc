== Refactoring: Removed MockContentCachingWrappingFilter

From now on, integration tests in XS2A are working properly with all XS2A filters and no longer rely on previously existing `MockContentCachingWrappingFilter`.

== Fixed syntax errors in CMS APIs

From now on, all path parameters in Swagger definitions of endpoints from `consent-aspsp-web`, `consent-psu-web` and `consent-xs2a-web` modules are correctly marked as required.

== Deprecated endpoint for getting information about TPP by TPP ID in CMS-ASPSP-API

Endpoint from `cms-aspsp-api` for getting information about TPP by its authorisation number with path parameter (`GET aspsp-api/v1/tpp/{tpp-id}`) has been deprecated, as the value passed in path parameter is not being used.
New endpoint without the path parameter (`GET aspsp-api/v1/tpp`) should be used instead.
Both endpoints require mandatory `tpp-authorisation-number` header to be passed with proper TPP authorisation number.

== Removed deprecated `tan` column from `pis_consent_authorization`

Deprecated column `tan` has been removed from `pis_consent_authorization` table in CMS database.

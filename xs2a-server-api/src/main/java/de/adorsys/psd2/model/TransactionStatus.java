/**
 * The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table: - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' -
 * Preceding check of technical validation was successful.   Customer profile check was also successful. - 'ACSC':
 * 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -   Settlement on the debtor’s account has been completed.    **Usage:** this can be
 * used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed.    **Warning:** this
 * status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.   It can only be used after
 * bilateral agreement. - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -   All preceding checks such as technical validation
 * and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. -
 * 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -   Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
 * - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -   Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance
 * not sent. - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -   Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted
 * without being posted to the creditor customer’s account. - 'RCVD': 'Received' -   Payment initiation has been
 * received by the receiving agent. - 'PDNG': 'Pending' -   Payment initiation or individual transaction included in
 * the payment initiation is pending.   Further checks and status update will be performed. - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
 * Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected. - 'CANC':
 * 'Cancelled'   Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution    **Remark:** *Change Request to ISO20022 is
 * still needed.*

/**
 * The following balance types are defined:   - \"closingBooked\":     Balance of the account at the end of the
 * pre-agreed account reporting period.     It is the sum of the opening booked balance at the beginning of the
 * period and all entries booked     to the account during the pre-agreed account reporting period.      For
 * card-accounts, this is composed of        - invoiced, but not yet paid entries    - \"expected\":     Balance
 * composed of booked entries and pending items known at the time of calculation,     which projects the end of day
 * balance if everything is booked on the account and no other entry is posted.      For card accounts, this is
 * composed of       - invoiced, but not yet paid entries,       - not yet invoiced but already booked entries and
 * - pending items (not yet booked)    - \"authorised\":     The expected balance together with the value of a
 * pre-approved credit line the ASPSP makes permanently available to the user.      For card-accounts:      \"money
 * to spend with the value of a pre-approved credit limit on the card account\"    - \"openingBooked\":     Book
 * balance of the account at the beginning of the account reporting period.     It always equals the closing book
 * balance from the previous report.   - \"interimAvailable\":     Available balance calculated in the course of the
 * account �servicer�s business day,     at the time specified, and subject to further changes during the business
 * day.     The interim balance is calculated on the basis of booked credit and debit items during the calculation
 * time/period specified.      For card-accounts, this is composed of       - invoiced, but not yet paid entries,
 * - not yet invoiced but already booked entries   - \"forwardAvailable\":     Forward available balance of money
 * that is at the disposal of the account owner on the date specified.   - \"nonInvoiced\":     Only for card
 * accounts, to be checked yet. #TODO CARD-ACCOUNTS nonInvoiced New in spec. detailes needed   - \"available\": #TODO
 * MISSING IN SPEC: 'available' New in spec. Detailes needed.

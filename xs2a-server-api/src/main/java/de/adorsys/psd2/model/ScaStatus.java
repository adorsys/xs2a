 * created successfully.   * 'psuIdentified':     The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation
 * resource has been identified.   * 'psuAuthenticated':     The PSU related to the authorisation or
 * cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified and authenticated e.g. by a password or by an access token
 * .   * 'scaMethodSelected':     The PSU/TPP has selected the related SCA routine.     If the SCA method is chosen
 * implicitly since only one SCA method is available,     then this is the first status to be reported instead of
 * 'received'.   * 'started':     The addressed SCA routine has been started.   * 'finalised':     The SCA routine
 * has been finalised successfully.   * 'failed':     The SCA routine failed   * 'exempted':     SCA was exempted for
 * the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful.

Optional Extension: As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all PSD2 related services for all available accounts.  As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account.  The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP.  This option is not supported for the Embedded SCA Approach.  As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights   * to see the list of available payment accounts or   * to see the list of available payment accounts with balances.

Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of  the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.  This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

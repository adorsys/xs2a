## What is it

With **PSD2** 
```
Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Payment Services in the
Internal Market, published 25 November 2016
```
 the European Union has forced Banking Market to open the Banking Services to Third Party Service Providers (TPP).
These services are accessible by TPP on behalf of a *Payment Service User* (PSU).

The 'Berlin Group' is a pan-European payments interoperability standards and harmonisation initiative.
Based on the PSD2 and EBA RTS requirements, Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 has worked on a detailed 
['Access to Account  (XS2A) Framework'](https://www.berlin-group.org/psd2-access-to-bank-accounts) with data model
(at conceptual, logical and physical data levels) and associated messaging.

[adorsys](https://adorsys-platform.de/solutions/xs2a-core/) is a company that works ever since the very beginning of PSD2 with its requirements and implicit tasks.

This XS2A Service provides an Open Source implementation of Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 Framework, that can be connected to ASPSPs middleware or core banking system.

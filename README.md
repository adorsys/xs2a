# XS2A Core: A reference Java implementation of NextGenPSD2 XS2A Interface of Berlin Group

This is adorsys XS2A Core: a fully PSD2 compliant XS2A interface, supporting every mandatory and the majority of optional PSD2 XS2A flows. It can be connected to any banking middleware or core banking system.
XS2A Core is the only open source (AGPL v.3) implementation of the NextGenPSD2 initiative fully supporting Berlin Group's specification for XS2A Interoperability Framework and its APIs. It is also the most secure solution in the market.
The software in this repository is for try-out only. It is delivered as-is and comes without any warranty, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

**Caveat:** This repository is not the latest version of XS2A Core as it runs with our enterprise clients. Do not use it in production environments! This public repository will only be updated every 6 months or so. It may contain security related issues that are already fixed with our customers but did not make it to the public repository, yet.

**Enterprise Version:** There is an enterprise version of XS2A Core that we proudly manage, adapt, extend, improve and operate for our enterprise clients, mostly European banks and open banking aggregators.

**Partnerships:** If you are an organization that would like to commercially use our solutions beyond AGPL v3 requirements, please get in contact. We already have partners that use XS2A Core as a foundation for their own offerings.

**Upcoming Regulation:** If you are interested in this project's further developments in the context of Berlin Group, Open Banking UK, PSD3, PSR, DORA and FIDA, please get in contact.

## Some Background

With **PSD2** Directive (EU) 2015/2366 the European Union has forced the Banking Market to open the Banking Services to Third Party Service Providers (TPP), given they act on behalf of the *Payment Service User*s (PSU).

The **Berlin Group** is a pan-European payments interoperability standards and harmonization initiative. Based on the PSD2 and EBA RTS requirements, Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 has worked on a detailed ['Access to Account  (XS2A) Framework'](https://www.berlin-group.org/psd2-access-to-bank-accounts) with a data model (at conceptual, logical and physical data levels) and associated messaging.

We at **[adorsys](https://adorsys.com/)** are IT and information architects. We build, secure and operate platforms for our customers in highly regulates industries, in particular finance for more than 15 years now. We are experts for open finance and have been active in this domain from the very beginning.

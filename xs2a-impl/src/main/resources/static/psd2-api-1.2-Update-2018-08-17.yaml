    # Summary
    The **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.2* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of 
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely. 
    The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards 
    in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,
    enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') 
    by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.
    
    The possible Approaches are:
      * Redirect SCA Approach
      * OAuth SCA Approach
      * Decoupled SCA Approach
      * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method
      * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available
      * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method
    
      Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches. 
      Futhermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional
      Therfore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support 
      a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.
    
      **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure 
      which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**
    
    ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:
    * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.** 
      It is not an replacement in any sense.
      The main specification is (at the moment) allways the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.
    * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**
    * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**
    * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]
      
        "If in is "header" and the name field is "Accept", "Content-Type" or "Authorization", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored."
      
      The element "Accept" will not be defined in this file at any place.
      
      The elements "Content-Type" and "Authorization" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags "content" and "security".
      
    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages, 
      but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.
      Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.
      We added them for the convinience of the user.
      If there is a payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.
      But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.
      
    * **We ommit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional) 
      except they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**
      Therefore the implementer might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements define in this file.
       
    ## General Remarks on Data Types
    
    The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least the following characters
    
    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

    post:
      summary: Payment initiation request 
      description: | 
        This method is used to initiate a payment at the ASPSP.
      
        ## Variants of Payment Initiation Requests
        
        This method to initiate a payment initiation at the ASPSP can be sent with either a JSON body or an pain.001 body depending on the payment product in the path.
        
        There are the following **payment products**:
        
          - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:
            - ***sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***instant-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***target-2-payments***
            - ***cross-border-credit-transfers***
          - Payment products with payment information in *pain.001* XML format:
            - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***pain.001-instant-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***pain.001-target-2-payments***
            - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***
        
        Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**
          * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.
          * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment iniatiation requests.
          
            In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.
            
            In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.
          * ***periodic-payments***: 
            Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId} 
             with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body. 
        
        This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.
          
        ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes
        
        The Payment Initiation Requests are independent from the need of one ore multilevel 
        SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments. 
        
        But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing. 
        
        For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation, 
        i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect' or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the 
        response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed. 
        Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response, 
        since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal. 
        In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.

      description: | 
        This method initiates the cancellation of a payment. 
        Depending on the payment-service, the payment-product and the ASPSP's implementation, 
        this TPP call might be sufficient to cancel a payment. 
        If an authorisation of the payment cancellation is mandated by the ASPSP, 
        a corresponding hyperlink will be contained in the response message.
        
        Cancels the addressed payment with resource identification paymentId if applicable to the payment-service, payment-product and received in product related timelines (e.g. before end of business day for scheduled payments of the last business day before the scheduled execution day). 
        
        The response to this DELETE command will tell the TPP whether the 
          * access method was rejected
          * access method was successful, or
          * access method is generally applicable, but further authorisation processes are needed.

    post: 
      summary: Start the authorisation process for a payment initiation
      description: | 
        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process. 
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data. 
        
        This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a 
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for 
        the corresponding PSU authorising the transaction.
        
        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case 
        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource 
        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the 
        payment data with the first POST payments/{payment-product} call.
        
        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation 
        or cancellation sub-resource. 
        
        This applies in the following scenarios:
        
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding Payment 
            Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms.
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' 
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding 
            Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for 
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

      summary: Update PSU data for payment initiation
      description: |
        This methods updates PSU data on the authorisation resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.
        
        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of 
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.

        There are several possible Update PSU Data requests in the context of payment initiation services needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:
        
        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the Payment Initiation Request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU Data Request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.
      
        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible Update PSU Data request can apply to all SCA approaches:
        
        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.
      
        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU Identification
          * Update PSU Authentication
          * Select PSU Autorization Method 
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

        This applies in the following scenarios:
        
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding Payment 
            Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms.
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' 
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding 
            Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for 
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

      summary: Update PSU Data for payment initiation cancellation
      description: | 
        This method updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a cancellation of the payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.
        
        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of 
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.
        
        This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed. 

        There are several possible Update PSU Data requests in the context of a cancellation authorisation within the payment initiation services needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:
        
        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the Payment Initiation Request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU Data Request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.
      
        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible Update PSU Data request can apply to all SCA approaches:
        
        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.
      
        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU Identification
          * Update PSU Authentication
          * Select PSU Autorization Method 
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

        It is assumed that a consent of the PSU to this access is already given and stored on the ASPSP system. 
        The addressed list of accounts depends then on the PSU ID and the stored consent addressed by consentId, 
        respectively the OAuth2 access token. 
        
        Returns all identifiers of the accounts, to which an account access has been granted to through

        In addition, relevant information about the accounts and hyperlinks to corresponding account 
        information resources are provided if a related consent has been already granted.
        
        Remark: Note that the /consents endpoint optionally offers to grant an access on all available

      description: | 
        This method create a consent resource, defining access rights to dedicated accounts of 
        a given PSU-ID. These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as 
        parameters as a core function.
        
        **Side Effects**
        When this Consent Request is a request where the "recurringIndicator" equals "true", 
        and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information 
        for the addressed PSU, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new 
        consent request is authorised by the PSU.
        
        Optional Extension:
        As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all psd2 related services for all available accounts. 
        
        As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account. 
        The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP. 
        This option is supported only within the Decoupled, OAuth2 or Re-direct SCA Approach. 
        As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights
          * to see the list of available payment accounts or
          * to see the list of available payment accounts with balances.

      summary: Start the authorisation process for a consent
      description: | 
        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a consent. 
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.
        
        his method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a 
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for 
        the corresponding PSU authorising the consent.
        
        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary, 
        since the related authorisation resource will be automatically created by 
        the ASPSP after the submission of the consent data with the first POST consents call.
        
        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation 
        or cancellation sub-resource. 
        
        This applies in the following scenarios:
        
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding Payment 
            Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms.
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' 
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding 
            Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for 
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

      summary: Update PSU Data for consents
      description: |  
        This method update PSU data on the consents  resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a consent within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.
        
        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of 
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.
        
        This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed. 

        There are several possible Update PSU Data requests in the context of a consent request if needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:
        
        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the Payment Initiation Request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU Data Request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.
      
        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible Update PSU Data request can apply to all SCA approaches:
        
        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.
      
        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU Identification
          * Update PSU Authentication
          * Select PSU Autorization Method 
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

      summary: Start the authorisation process for a signing basket
      description: | 
        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a signing basket. 
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.
        
        This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a 
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for 
        the corresponding PSU authorising the signing-baskets.
        
        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case 
        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource 
        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the 
        payment data with the first POST signing basket call.
        
        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation 
        or cancellation sub-resource. 
        
        This applies in the following scenarios:
        
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding Payment 
            Initiation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms.
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' 
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceeding 
            Payment Cancellation Response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for 
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

      summary: Update PSU Data for signing basket
      description: | 
        This method update PSU data on the signing basket resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a igning basket within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.
        
        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of 
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.
        
        This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed. 

        There are several possible Update PSU Data requests in the context of a consent request if needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:
        
        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU Data Request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the Payment Initiation Request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU Data Request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.
      
        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible Update PSU Data request can apply to all SCA approaches:
        
        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.
      
        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU Identification
          * Update PSU Authentication
          * Select PSU Autorization Method 
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method need a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

          **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information. 
          It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
        - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' - 
          All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
        - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' - 
          Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
        - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' - 
          Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.

          Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customer’s account.
        - 'RCVD': 'Received' - 
          Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
        - 'PDNG': 'Pending' - 
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending. 
          Further checks and status update will be performed.
        - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' - 
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
        - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
          Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution

        More authentication types might be added during implementation projects and documented in the ASPSP documentation.
        
          - 'SMS_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP linked to the transaction to be authorised is sent to the PSU through a SMS channel.
          - 'CHIP_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP is generated by a chip card, e.g. an TOP derived from an EMV cryptogram. 
            To contact the card, the PSU normally needs a (handheld) device. 
            With this device, the PSU either reads the challenging data through a visual interface like flickering or 
            the PSU types in the challenge through the device key pad. 
            The device then derives an OTP from the challenge data and displays the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PHOTO_OTP': An SCA method, where the challenge is a QR code or similar encoded visual data 
            which can be read in by a consumer device or specific mobile app. 
            The device resp. the specific app than derives an OTP from the visual challenge data and displays 
            the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PUSH_OTP': An OTP is pushed to a dedicated authentication APP and displayed to the PSU.

        SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU.

        This preference might be ignored by the ASPSP, if a signing basket is not supported as functionality.
        
        If it equals "false" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP. 
        This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step, 
        without using a signing basket.

      Signing basket mathods are used for authorising several transactions with one SCA method. 
  - name: Common AIS and PIS Services
    description: |
      Processes on starting authorisations, update PSU identification or PSU authentication data and explicit 
      authorisation of transactions by using SCA are very similar in PIS and AIS services. 
      The API calls supporting these processes are described in the following independently from the service/endpoint. 
      For reasons of clarity, the endpoints are defined always for the Payment Initiation Service, the Payment Cancellation, 
      the Account Information Service (Consents), and Signing Baskets separately. 
      These processes usually are used following a hyperlink of the ASPSP.

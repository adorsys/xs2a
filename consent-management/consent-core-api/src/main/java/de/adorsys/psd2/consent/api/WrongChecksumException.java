 * This exception is added to terminate the flow of AIS consent persisting to CMS for the conditions below:
 * - the consent is already in VALID status;
 * - someone is trying to change definite private (ASPSP-specific) fields in this consent, for example, aspspAccountId.
 *
 * The mechanisms for checking are located in 'ChecksumCalculatingFactory.java' and support version increasing in case of
 * adding or deleting the private fields to be controlled.
 *
 * If the validation mechanism fails - changed consent and/or its account accesses are NOT persisted to CMS because of this exception,
 * which is capable of rolling back the chain of transactions.

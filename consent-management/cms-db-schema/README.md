# How to work with liquibase:

* If you migrate to liquibase from our project versions that are earlier than 1.4, delete all tables and sequences in your postgres database (if you already have them). Better do it with such tools as pgAdmin or Dbeaver to be sure that you deleted everything (or use command line).

* If you migrate to liquibase from our project versions that are earlier than 1.12, delete all tables and sequences in your postgres database (if you already have them). Better do it with such tools as pgAdmin or Dbeaver to be sure that you deleted everything (or use command line).

* Create new scheme 'consent' in DB 

* Go to module cms-db-schema in the project.

* Copy “liquibase.example.properties”, paste it in the same module near the old one and name it ” liquibase.properties”, so now you will have 2 “properties” files: “liquibase.properties” and ” liquibase.example.properties”.

* Run in the command line: 
```
 mvn liquibase:update
```

You should see the response “Build success” in the console after performing the update.

If you'd like to have different properties to connect to different databases, you may specify property file using the maven variable:
```
 mvn -DpropertyFile=my-special-property-file.properties liquibase:update
```


# How to deliver liquibase migrations

by invoking
```bash
mvn package
```
man build jar-file, that contains all migrations.
Adding this jar as a dependency to your project you get access to migration files and can use it with liquibase.
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
        <artifactId>cms-db-schema</artifactId>
    </dependency>

```
